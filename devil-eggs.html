    <p>Fucking deviled eggs man, the amount of <strong>a goddamn willpower</strong> to not inhale an entire plate 
    of these badboys during the holidays is almost impossible for me.</p>
    <p>My own mother has to hide them to serve the rest of the family, before getting to me.</p>

    <p>So today, were going to make our own.</p>


    <p><strong>Ingredients</strong></p>

    <ul>
        <li>Boiled eggs</li>
        <li>Mayo</li>
        <li>Paprika</li>
    </ul>
    <p>How many eggs? just follow your heart. but in all honestly if you're planing on serving guests during the holidays or other events; a whole carton of 24 eggs (it will give you a chance to serve seconds) for yourself idk 12 carton of eggs  </p>
    <p>Google if you don't know how to boiled eggs, and make sure its hard boiled.</p>
    <p>Avoid the "sweeter" kind of mayo like Miracle Whip, its just not that pleasant of a taste to have in deviled eggs what I usually go for is the Hellman mayo, its more savory which is what we want in this recipes</p>
    <p>Paprika is always optional but it adds a wonderful smokey flavor to the eggs</p>

    <p>Steps</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut your boiled eggs in half</li>
        <li>put the yolks into a bowl, and put the white of the eggs on your serving plate.</li>
        <li>crush all the yolks with whatever utensil you have</li>
        <li>add a tablespoon  of mayo at the time to the yolks, with each new tablesppon due a taste test to see if its you your liking</li>
        <li>Once the filing is up to your standard, grab a spoon and put back the yolks onto the whites of the eggs</li>
        <li>remember their should be enough of the yolks for all of yours eggs so spread evenly</li>
        <li>sprinkle paprika onto the eggs </li>
        <li>put a plastic wrap over the eggs or a lid (make sure their sealed correctly if not leaving the devil eggs to the elements will make them actually fucking unedible</li>
        <li>let them chill in the fridge for a bit or if like me just eat them right away.</li>
    
    </ol>
