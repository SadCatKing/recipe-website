    <h1>Its like a good little snack</h1>
    <p>this is the only lie in the recipe i do not crave this one a lot but its the quickest recipe i could think of it</p>

    <p>Ingredients</p>
    <ul>
        
    <li>oatmeal, I use quick oats because its what i have</li>
    <li>yogurt</li>
    <li>no sugar peanutt butter</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Steps</p>

    <ol>
        <li>grab a cup of oatmeal</li>
        <li>if you want you can blend, it will make almost like cake-y texture to it at the end, which is fun</li>
        <li>personally I just eyeball it so add whatever amount of yogurt I want but just enough that the oats are like covered in it</li>
        <li>I just grab the biggest spoon I have in my utensil drawer and just add that amount to</li>
        <li>mix it reaaaaaal good</li>
        <li>eat the goddamn thing</li>
    </ol>

    <p>thats it, enjoy the gruel</p>
